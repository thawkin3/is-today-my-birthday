# Is Today My Birthday

The best, easiest, and fastest way to determine if today is your birthday.

This is a simple REST API built with Node and Express that tells you whether or not today is your birthday. Tests were written using Insomnia and the Inso CLI tool and are run as part of a continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Running the App Locally

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Running the Tests Locally

`yarn test` to run the Insomnia test suite (Make sure you have the app running already in a separate terminal window. Otherwise, use `yarn ci:start-and-test` instead to start the app and run the tests all in one command.)

## Available Endpoints

- `/`
- `/istodaymybirthday`

## NPM Scripts

- `ci:start-and-test`: Concurrently starts the app and runs the unit tests (used as part of the GitHub Actions workflow for CI)
- `ci:test`: Waits for the app to be running locally on port 3000 and then runs the unit tests
- `format`: Formats the code using Prettier
- `format-watch`: Formats the code using Prettier in watch mode
- `start`: Starts the app locally with a Node Express.js server running on port 3000
- `test`: Runs the Insomnia test suite
